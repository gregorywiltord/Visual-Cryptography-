# Visual Cryptography Project

This is a simple web application that demonstrates visual cryptography. The application allows users to register with their name and upload an image, which is then divided into two shares using visual cryptography techniques.

## Requirements

- PHP 7 or later
- MySQL or MariaDB database
- Apache server or similar to run the PHP application
- GD library for image manipulation in PHP (usually included by default in PHP installations)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local server directory or hosting service.
2. Create a new database and import the `cryotography.sql` file to set up the required table.
3. Update the database connection details in `register.php` and `login.php` files with your own database credentials.

## How to Use

### Registration

1. Access the web application using your server URL.
2. Click on the "Register" link to go to the registration page.
3. Fill in your name, choose an image file, and click on the "Register" button.
4. The image will be divided into two shares, and one share will be saved in the database while the other share will be provided as a downloadable link. Also, the share2 will be converted to a long string and displayed as your password.

### Login

1. Click on the "Login" link to go to the login page.
2. Enter your registered name and the password provided during registration (share2 string).
3. If the shares match, the original image will be displayed.

## Security Note

This is a simple demonstration project and is not meant for production use. It uses basic image manipulation techniques for visual cryptography and does not employ strong security measures for password management.

For a real-world application, use secure password hashing algorithms and additional security measures.
